# My dotfiles

In this repo I store some configuration files that I use in my system.

If you want to use these too, just run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dpbm/linux-dotfiles
cd linux-dotfiles
bash run.sh
```

These configs are for:
* [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
* [nvim](https://neovim.io/)
* [nvchad](https://nvchad.com/)
* [tilix](https://github.com/gnunn1/tilix)
* [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
* [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
* [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
* [xorg](https://www.x.org/)
* [i3](https://i3wm.org/)
* [PowerLevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
